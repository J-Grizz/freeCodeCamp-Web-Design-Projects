          Set in a magical world where woman called "Aes Sedai" can weild one
          half of a magical power called "The One Power" and any men that can weild this
          power quickly become insane due to the taint left behind by the "Dark One"
          in ages past after being defeated and imprisoned by "Lews Theris" otherwise
          knows as "The Dragon". This is one of the most epic stories ever told and here is
          a list of each book with a synopsis and the date of release:
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li>The Eye of the World:
            <br></br>
            The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth,
            and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of
            Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet
            fall under the Shadow.
            <br></br>
            When The Two Rivers is attacked by Trollocs―a savage tribe of half-men, half-beasts― five villagers flee
            that night into a world they barely imagined, with new dangers waiting in the shadows and in the light.
            <br></br>

          <li>The Great Hunt:
            <br></br>
            The Wheel of Time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth,
            and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth returns again.
            <br></br>
            For centuries, gleemen have told the tales of The Great Hunt of the Horn. So many tales about each of the
            Hunters, and so many Hunters to tell of. Now, the Horn itself is found: the Horn of Valere long thought
            only legend, the Horn which will raise the dead heroes of the ages.
            <br></br>
            And it is stolen.

            -15 November 1990</li>

          <li>The Dragon Reborn:
            <br></br>
            In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what
            will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.
            <br></br>
            Winter has stopped the war―almost―yet men are dying, calling out for the Dragon. But where is he? In the
            Heart of the Stone lies the next great test of the Dragon reborn.
            <br></br>
            - 15 October 1991</li>

          <li>The Shadow Rising:
            <br></br>
            The Stone of Tear, invulnerable fortress of legend, has fallen. The Children of the Dragon have risen to
            the call of prophecy and march to the aid of the Light. Callandor, the Sword That Is Not a Sword, is held
            by Rand al' Thor, the man proclaimed as the Dragon Reborn. But still the shadows lengthen and still the
            Forsaken grow in strength. If he is to fight them, Rand must master the male half of the True Source, a
            power corrupted by the Dark One, a power that drives men to madness, a power that may save or damn the
            world.
            <br></br>
            - 15 September 1992</li>

          <li>The Fires of Heaven:
            <br></br>
            ...Into the forbidden city of Rhuidean, where Rand al'Thor, now the Dragon Reborn, must conceal his present
            endeavor from all about him, even Egwene and Moiraine.
            <br></br>
            ...Into the Amyrlin's study in the White Tower, where Amyrlin, Flaida do Avriny a 'Roihan, is weaving new
            plans.
            <br></br>
            ...Into the luxurious hidden chamber where the Forsaken Rahvin is meeting with three of his fellows to
            ensure their ultimate victory over the Dragon.
            <br></br>
            ...Into the Queen's court in Caemlyn, where Morgase is curiously in thrall to the handsome Lord Gaebril.
            <br></br>
            For once the Dragon walks the land, the fires of Heaven fall where they will, until all men's lives are
            ablaze. And in Shayol Ghul, the Dark One stirs
            <br></br>
            - 15 October 1993</li>

          <li>Lord of Chaos:
            <br></br>
            As the Wheel turns, the winds of fate roil across the land. Rand al 'Thor struggles to unite the nations
            for the Last Battle when the Dark One will break free into the world to spring the snares laid by the
            immortal Forsaken for unwary humankind. The White Tower in Tar Valon, under the Amyrlin Elaida, has decided
            that Rand must be controlled immediately. Drought and summer heat linger into winter and Nineveh al'Meara
            and Elayne, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, begin a desperate search for the fabled ter'angreal that may enable
            them to restore normal weather conditions.
            <br></br>
            - 15 October 1994</li>

          <li>A Crown of Swords:
            <br></br>
            Elayne, Aviendha, and Mat come ever closer to the bowl ter'angreal that may reverse the world's endless
            heat wave and restore natural weather. Egwene begins to gather all manner of women who can channel: Sea
            Folk, Windfinders, Wise Ones, and some surprising others. And above all, Rand faces the dread Forsaken
            Sammael, in the shadows of Shadar Logoth, where the blood-hungry mist, Mashadar, waits for prey.
            <br></br>
            - 15 May 1996</li>

          <li>The Path of Daggers:
            <br></br>
            The Seanchan invasion force is in possession of Ebou Dar. Nynaeve, Elayne, and Aviendha head for Caemlyn
            and Elayne's rightful throne, but on the way they discover an enemy much worse than the Seanchan.
            <br></br>
            In Illian, Rand vows to throw the Seanchan back as he did once before. But signs of madness are appearing
            among the Asha'man.
            <br></br>
            In Ghealdan, Perrin faces the intrigues of Whitecloaks, Seanchan invaders, the scattered Shaido Aiel, and
            the Prophet himself. Perrin's beloved wife, Faile, may pay with her life, and Perrin himself may have to
            destroy his soul to save her.
            <br></br>
            Meanwhile, the rebel Aes Sedai under their young Amyrlin, Egwene al'Vere, face an army that intends to keep
            them away from the White Tower. But Egwene is determined to unseat the usurper Elaida and reunite the Aes
            Sedai. She does not yet understand the price that others - and she herself - will pay.
            <br></br>
            - 20 October 1998</li>

          <li>Winter's Heart:
            <br></br>
            Rand is on the run with Min, and in Cairhein, Cadsuane is trying to figure out where he is headed. Rand's
            destination is, in fact, one she has never considered. Mazrim Taim, leader of the Black Tower, is revealed
            to be a liar. But what is he up to? Faile, with the Aiel Maidens, Bain and Chiad, and her companions, Queen
            Alliandre and Morgase, is prisoner of Savanna's sept.Perrin is desperately searching for Faile. With Elyas
            Machera, Berelain, the Prophet and a very mixed "army" of disparate forces, he is moving through country
            rife with bandits and roving Seanchan.
            <br></br>
            The Forsaken are ever more present, and united, and the man called Slayer stalks Tel'aran'rhiod and the
            wolfdream. In Ebou Dar, the Seanchan princess known as Daughter of the Nine Moons arrives - and Mat, who
            had been recuperating in the Tarasin Palace, is introduced to her. Will the marriage that has been foretold
            come about?
            <br></br>
            - 7 November 2000</li>

          <li>Crossroads of Twilight:
            <br></br>
            Mat Cauthon is fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to
            marry. He learns that he can neither safely keep her nor let her go, for both the Shadow and the might of
            the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit.
            <br></br>
            Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance
            with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is
            willing to sell his soul.
            <br></br>
            At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes
            Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible. Unless the Aes Sedai are
            reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold
            the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower.
            <br></br>
            In Andor, Elayne Trakand fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends
            surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn
            with it.
            <br></br>
            Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True
            Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is
            clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared - even one prophesied to save the world.
            Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really
            enemies.
            <br></br>
            - 7 January 2003</li>

          <li>Knife of Dreams:
            <br></br>
            The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable:
            All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn,
            must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. But Rand dares not fight until he possesses all the
            surviving seals on the Dark One's prison and has dealt with the Seanchan, who threaten to overrun all
            nations this side of the Aryth Ocean and increasingly seem too entrenched to be fought off. But his attempt
            to make a truce with the Seanchan is shadowed by treachery that may cost him everything. Whatever the
            price, though, he must have that truce. And he faces other dangers.
            <br></br>
            The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are
            changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin
            and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One
            will triumph
            <br></br>
            - 11 October 2005</li>

          <li>Important Note:
            <br></br>
            Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.The final volume of the Wheel of Time, A
            Memory of Light, was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon
            Sanderson, New York Times best-selling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor - his
            wife, Harriet McDougal - to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it
            could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents The Gathering Storm as the first of
            three novels that will make up A Memory of Light. This short sequence will complete the struggle against
            the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost 20 years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel
            of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era. In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international
            best-selling series begins its dramatic conclusion.
            <br></br>
            RIP Mr Joran, the legacy you have left behind is great, you will always be a legends, genius, and all round
            role model in my eyes.
            <br></br>
            17 October 1948 - 16 September 2007
          </li>

          <li>The Gathering Storm:
            <br></br>
            Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in
            preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward - wishing he
            could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders - his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems
            to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.
            <br></br>
            Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the
            whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene
            works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of
            increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will
            decide the future of the White Tower - and possibly the world itself.
            <br></br>
            The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under
            the Shadow.
            <br></br>
            - 27 October 2009</li>

          <li>Towers of Midnight:
            <br></br>
            The Last Battle has started. The seals on the Dark One's prison are crumbling. The Pattern itself is
            unraveling, and the armies of the Shadow have begun to boil out of the Blight. The sun has begun to set
            upon the Third Age. Perrin Aybara is now hunted by specters from his past: Whitecloaks, a slayer of wolves,
            and the responsibilities of leadership. All the while, an unseen foe is slowly pulling a noose tight around
            his neck. To prevail, he must seek answers in Tel'aran'rhiod and find a way - at long last - to master the
            wolf within him or lose himself to it forever.
            <br></br>
            Meanwhile, Matrim Cauthon prepares for the most difficult challenge of his life. The creatures beyond the
            stone gateways - the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn - have confused him, taunted him, and left him hanged, his
            memory stuffed with bits and pieces of other men's lives. He had hoped that his last confrontation with
            them would be the end of it, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. The time is coming when he will again
            have to dance with the Snakes and the Foxes, playing a game that cannot be won. The Tower of Ghenjei
            awaits, and its secrets will reveal the fate of a friend long lost.

          <li>A Memory of Light:
            <br></br>
            'And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on
            the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed and hope died.' - Charal Drianaan
            te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon.
            <br></br>
            In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gathered to join behind Rand al'Thor, or to stop him
            frmo his plan to break the seals on the Dark One's prison - which may be a sign of his madness, or the last
            hope of humankind. Egwene, the Amyrlin Seat leans toward the former.

            All humanity is in peril - and the outcome will be decided in Shayol Ghul itself. The Wheel is turning, and
            the Age is coming to its end. The Last Battle will determine the fate of the world...
